# Best Structure

## Intro

Best considered in two half's. The first 32 a introduction of the bass and
percussion. The Second 32 the musical body steadily building to the first
breakdown. This can be halved.

## Breakdown 8 bar sweep

Descends after the crescendo. Usually dropping to the verse or chorus part of
the Breakdown.

## Breakdown 32 bar

This is the most traditional structure. Verse - Bridge or Verse - Chorus.
Steadily building towards the first Drop.

## Drop 64 bar (in-between the two traditional breakdowns)

Most happy hardcore will have two Breakdowns. The first at the 32 bar or 64 bar
point. This will be proceeded by a 64 middle and a following 16 bar breakdown.

## Breakdown 16 bar

The second breakdown is usually half the size of the first breakdown.
