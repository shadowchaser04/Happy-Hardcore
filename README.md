# The structure of happy hardcore

## B.P.M and D.A.W's

All D.A.W's (digital audio workstation)s use a grid. The grid is a system that
enables the user to place instrument parts or scenes at a particular point in
the track time. To do this there is a count of beats per minute. The BPM is
then divided in to quadrants (4s) that comprise the grid. Each quadrant
contains 4 bars. 1 bar also has 4 measures. Happy hardcore will usually contain
4 beats per bar. One beat at the start of each measure.

## Happy hardcore

Happy Hardcore music has a consistent structure. It evolves to cycles of 8, 16,
or 32 bars. Most Genre will have a consistent structure that is recognised as that
particular style.

`Intro and Verse (32-64 bars) Breakdown (16-32 bars) Drop and Verse (32-64 bars) Breakdown (8-16 bars) Outro (16-32)`
